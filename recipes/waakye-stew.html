  <h2>Waakye Stew</h2>
  <p>Waakye stew is a rich, savory, and deep red tomato-based stew that is the quintessential accompaniment to the Ghanaian rice and bean dish, waakye. Unlike simpler stews, waakye stew is layered with flavor through a multi-step cooking process.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>For the protein:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 kg goat meat, beef, or a mix of meats (including cow skin or tripe, if desired), cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 thumb-sized piece of ginger</li>
    <li>2–3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1–2 Scotch bonnet peppers (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tsp mixed spices (e.g., coriander, cumin, paprika)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For the stew base:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable or groundnut oil</li>
    <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced or julienned</li>
    <li>1 small can (about 150g) tomato paste</li>
    <li>700g fresh, ripe tomatoes, blended</li>
    <li>1–2 Scotch bonnet peppers, blended with the tomatoes (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground dried shrimp powder (optional, but recommended for authentic flavor)</li>
    <li>1 tsp mixed spices</li>
    <li>1–2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>Stock from steaming the meat</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Wash and cut your meat into desired sizes</li>
    <li>In a pot, combine the meat, chopped onion, ginger, garlic, Scotch bonnet, mixed spices, and salt. Add a small amount of water, just enough to prevent the pot from burning.</li>
    <li>Steam the meat over medium heat until it is tender.</li>
    <li>Remove the cooked meat from the pot and set it aside. Reserve the flavorful meat stock, straining it to remove any bits.</li>
    <li>In a large pot or saucepan, heat the oil.</li>
    <li>Fry the meat in the hot oil until it is browned and has some texture. Remove the fried meat and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat and add the thinly sliced onions to the same oil. Fry until they are soft and caramelized, which should take about 10–15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Push the caramelized onions to the side of the pot and add the tomato paste to the center.</li>
    <li>Fry the tomato paste, stirring constantly, until it darkens in color. This process removes the raw, sour taste and gives the stew a deeper flavor.</li>
    <li>Add the blended fresh tomatoes and peppers to the pot, stirring to combine them with the tomato paste and onions.</li>
    <li>Continue to fry the tomato mixture, stirring regularly, until the oil separates and rises to the top. This indicates that the water has evaporated and the stew base is well-cooked.</li>
    <li>Add the reserved meat stock, shrimp powder, bay leaves, and mixed spices to the pot. Stir well.</li>
    <li>Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for at least 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
    <li>Add the fried meat to the stew and stir to coat. Simmer for another 5–10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, if needed.</li>
    <li>Serve the rich, dark stew hot over your waakye.</li>
