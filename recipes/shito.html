  <h1>Shito Recipe</h1>
  <img src="IMG_1305-scaled.webp" alt="A picture of a finished shito" width="500px">

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 liters of vegetable oil (or enough to cover ingredients while cooking)</li>
    <li>2 large yellow or white onions, blended</li>
    <li>50g ginger root, peeled and blended</li>
    <li>6–8 cloves of garlic, peeled and blended</li>
    <li>8 Scotch bonnet or habanero peppers, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups ground dried fish (like herring or anchovies)</li>
    <li>1 cup ground dried shrimp</li>
    <li>½ cup tomato paste (optional, but adds richness)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp aniseed, ground</li>
    <li>1 tsp rosemary, ground</li>
    <li>Salt or seasoning cubes to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Blend the aromatics: In a food processor, blend the onions, ginger, garlic, and peppers into a smooth paste. It is important to use as little water as possible, as you will cook all the moisture out later.</li>
    <li>Prepare the dry fish and shrimp: Grind the dried fish and shrimp into a fine powder or coarse flakes. You can do this with a food processor or a spice grinder.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil: In a very large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the blended aromatics: Carefully add the blended onion, ginger, and garlic mixture to the hot oil.</li>
    <li>Cook out the moisture: Cook and stir frequently for about 30–45 minutes, or until all the moisture has evaporated and the paste has dried out and browned. This is a crucial step for preventing mold and ensuring a long shelf life.</li>
    <li>Fry the tomato paste: If using tomato paste, add it now and stir constantly for another 15–20 minutes. The paste will darken in color and lose its raw taste.</li>
    <li>Add the seasonings and powders: Stir in the ground chili pepper, ground dried fish, and ground dried shrimp. The sauce will begin to turn from reddish-brown to a much darker color.</li>
    <li>Add spices: Mix in the ground aniseed, rosemary, and other powdered spices, if using.</li>
    <li>Simmer and stir: Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook the mixture for 1 to 1.5 hours. Stir every 10–15 minutes to prevent the sauce from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Develop the color: The sauce will continue to darken as it cooks and caramelizes. Once it has reached a very deep brown or black color, it is ready.</li>
    <li>Adjust seasoning: Taste and add salt or seasoning cubes as needed</li>
    <li>Cool completely: Remove the pot from the heat and allow the shito to cool completely before storing.</li>
    <li>Jar it: Transfer the cooled shito into sterilized, airtight glass jars.</li>
    <li>Use extra oil for preservation: Make sure there is a layer of oil covering the top of the shito in each jar. This seals the sauce and helps preserve it.</li>
    <li>Store: For long-term storage, keep the shito in the refrigerator. Use a clean, dry spoon every time you use it to prevent spoilage.</li>
  </ol>
